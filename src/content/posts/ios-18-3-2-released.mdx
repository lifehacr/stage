Apple has provided a standard update description for this release. The company states that the update 'includes important bug fixes, security enhancements, and resolves an issue that may prevent some streaming content from playing.' Apple typically refrains from disclosing or discussing security vulnerabilities until they have been thoroughly investigated and patched, leaving the details of these security updates unknown for now.

That being said, the update does include a few noteworthy additions. It introduces a supplemental patch for a WebKit exploit that was initially addressed in iOS 17.2. This vulnerability enabled a specially designed website to bypass the Web Content sandbox and potentially compromise devices.

Another key detail is that the update re-enables Apple Intelligence by default. Users who prefer not to use it will need to revisit their settings to disable it once again. While this may be a small inconvenience, iPhone and iPad users might have to get accustomed to this routine, as a similar issue was reported following the iOS 18.3.1 update.

Other than that, this is a pretty simple update. It’s still important to make sure your iPhone is updated to the latest OS to prevent any issues.

In addition to iOS 18.3.2, Apple also released updates for Safari, along with macOS Sequoia 15.3.2 for Macs, visionOS 2.3.2 for the Apple Vision Pro, and tVOS 18.3.1 for Apple TV devices.

## Which iPhones and iPads Are Compatible with iOS 18.3.2?
